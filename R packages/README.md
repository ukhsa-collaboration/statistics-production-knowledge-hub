## ukhsaGuidanceDocs

This package is used to help create our guidance documents. It is unlikely to have much outside appeal. 

Specifically, it is used to populate the version history at the top of each HTML document, as well as handling citations and populating reference lists.

### Installation: 

`devtools::install_github(repo = "ukhsa-collaboration/statistics-production-knowledge-hub", ref = "main", subdir = "R packages/GuidanceDocs")`
