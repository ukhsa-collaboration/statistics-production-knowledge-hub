    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div id="defining-quality" class="section level3">
    <h3>Defining quality</h3>
    <p>The quality of a statistical output may be thought of in simple
    terms as its “fitness for purpose” [<a href="#References">1</a>][<a href="#References">2</a>][<a href="#References">3</a>][<a href="#References">4</a>]. The ONS Code of Practice uses the 5
    Dimensions of Quality of the European Statistical System (ESS) Code
    of Practice as criteria for assessing fitness for purpose of
    statistical outputs. These 5 dimensions are:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> statistics meet the needs of
    users</li>
    <li><strong>Accuracy and Reliability:</strong> statistics accurately
    and reliably portray reality</li>
    <li><strong>Timeliness and Punctuality:</strong> statistics are
    released in a timely and punctual manner</li>
    <li><strong>Comparability and Coherence:</strong> statistics are
    consistent internally, over time and comparable between regions and
    countries; it is possible to combine and make joint use of related
    data from different data sources</li>
    <li><strong>Accessibility and Clarity:</strong> statistics are
    presented in a clear and understandable form, released in a suitable
    and convenient manner, available and accessible on an impartial
    basis with supporting metadata and guidance</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Quality assurance (QA) of a statistical output is the process of
    ensuring that these criteria have been met during its production and
    demonstrating this fact to users.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="why-we-need-quality-assurance" class="section level3">
    <h3>Why we need quality assurance</h3>
    <p>The ONS Code of Practice includes quality as one of the 3 core
    pillars that support public confidence in statistics [<a href="#References">1</a>]. Principle Q3 of the Quality Pillar
    requires all producers of statistics and other analytical outputs to
    explain how they have assured that their work is accurate, reliable,
    coherent and timely [<a href="#References">1</a>]. Similarly, a key
    goal of the Government Statistical Service (GSS) Quality Strategy is
    to ensure our outputs are of sufficient quality and communicate the
    quality implications to users [<a href="#References">5</a>].</p>
    <p>This shows that there is a need to not only to guarantee quality
    but also demonstrate it to users, allowing them to use statistical
    publications with confidence in their validity [<a href="#References">5</a>][<a href="#References">6</a>]. High quality
    also helps build trust among those who are involved in policy and
    decision making [<a href="#References">2</a>][<a href="#References">3</a>]. Outputs that attain high levels of
    fitness-for-purpose allow better decisions to be made with greater
    efficiency.[<a href="#References">3</a>][<a href="#References">5</a>][<a href="#References">7</a>]. The Goldacre
    Review explains the material benefits of high-quality analysis,
    noting that “these kinds of analyses deliver direct improvements in
    patient care by identifying problems early, and improving the
    efficiency of services for all.” [<a href="#References">5</a>] The
    risks posed by poor quality analysis are just as immediate and can
    include financial and legal damage as well as risks to health and
    livelihood [<a href="#References">4</a>]. It is therefore crucial
    that internal and external outputs are subject to rigorous quality
    assurance measures.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div id="roles-and-responsibilities" class="section level2">
    <h2>Roles and responsibilities</h2>
    <p>Goal 1 of the GSS Quality Strategy sets out the need for everyone
    involved in statistical production to know their role in assuring
    quality [<a href="#References">5</a>]. Team members should
    understand the exact QA plans for a project as well as their
    expected contributions [<a href="#References">6</a>].</p>
    <p>The Aqua Book defines 3 key roles for QA of statistical analysis:
    the commissioner, the analyst, and the assurer [<a href="#References">4</a>][<a href="#References">7</a>]. In practice,
    the exact nature of roles required may differ based on project scope
    and needs, but these 3 roles provide a useful framework for
    considering the different ways QA should be built into the life
    cycle of a project.</p>
    <p>The roles can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <p><strong>The person commissioning analysis</strong> (“the
    commissioner”) is responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>developing the question of interest and communicating this to
    the analyst and assurer so that they can identify the most
    appropriate methods for analysis and assurance</li>
    <li>clearly expressing the needs of the project and risks that are
    entailed so that proportionate levels of QA can be decided upon by
    the analyst</li>
    </ul>
    <p>People of all levels of seniority commission analysis. The
    commissioner may be acting on behalf of a government decision-maker
    or other customer, or they may be a policy lead in the area where
    work is being commissioned.</p>
    <p><strong>The person leading the analysis</strong> (“the analyst”)
    is responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>working with the commissioner to help develop the question of
    interest in a way that allows it to be answered appropriately and
    meet the needs of the commissioner</li>
    <li>planning how they will demonstrate assured quality to the
    commissioner, assurer, and end users of their analytical output</li>
    <li>as needed, bringing in third party analysts to provide
    specialised advice and quality assurance.</li>
    <li>providing final results and records of all work they have
    done</li>
    <li>communicating to the commissioner the implications of their
    results, including strengths, limitations, uncertainty, and
    context</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In practice, there may often be more than one analyst involved in
    a project: the use of the term “the analyst” is used for brevity’s
    sake.</p>
    <p><strong>The person responsible for analytical assurance</strong>
    (“the assurer”) is responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>ensuring that appropriate quality assurance is taking place
    throughout</li>
    <li>providing intermediate and final sign-offs for the output</li>
    <li>advising the commissioner on whether quality concerns have been
    sufficiently addressed and the implications of any remaining
    risks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This person is not directly involved in conducting QA and does
    not need to be an analyst. However, QA may benefit from an assurer
    who understands the analytical methods used in the project so that
    they can identify issues with the output. Because the assurer signs
    off on the QA activities, they should have enough seniority to take
    responsibility for the output. For example, they might be a senior
    analyst or analytical project manager.</p>
    <p>More information about what each of these roles involves can be
    found in the next section. However, it is important to emphasise
    that QA does not begin and end with designated roles and project
    components. Quality can best be guaranteed by a culture of
    transparency and accountability that is supported by all members of
    a team. This includes encouraging everyone on the team to be open
    about their ideas, mistakes, and concerns without fear of
    repercussions or dismissive attitudes from senior staff.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="how-is-quality-assurance-conducted" class="section level2">
    <h2>How is Quality Assurance Conducted?</h2>
    <p>This section contains examples of questions that can guide QA
    throughout a project and suggested items of documentation that can
    be produced. However, the exact scale and scope of these QA
    activities should be considered on a case-by-case basis, ensuring
    that they are appropriate and proportionate to the needs of analysis
    [<a href="#References">4</a>]. More rigorous QA will demand more
    time and resources, and so the extent of QA should be justified by
    the level of risk present [<a href="#References">4</a>][<a href="#References">6</a>].</p>
    <div id="measuring-and-proving-quality-advice-for-qa-log-books" class="section level3">
    <h3>Measuring and proving quality: advice for QA log books</h3>
    <p>At each stage of analysis, documentation should be produced
    detailing QA measures that have been undertaken. This helps
    guarantee that analysis and QA are transparent and reproducible, in
    line with ONS Code of Practice Q3.3 [<a href="#References">1</a>],
    thereby helping to create high-quality statistics that retain value
    over time.</p>
    <p>Providing evidence of quality in statistics should be structured
    around the ESS quality dimensions outlined earlier in this document.
    One of the most common formats for a QA log is a checklist in the
    form of an Excel workbook. This is a useful format because it allows
    QA to be broken down into different stages and quality dimensions by
    creating different sheets within the workbook. The QA log can then
    be shared with analysts, commissioners, and assurers to keep them
    updated about QA progress and allow for assurer sign-off as needed.
    Such workbooks can also be reused and adapted for different
    projects. <a href="...">There is an example spreadsheet available on
    our GitHub</a> containing examples of checklist elements that may be
    useful to include in a QA log. While it is not a complete list of QA
    concerns, the template is provides a starting point for thinking
    about the assurance process. Please refer to the guidance within the
    template for advice on how to use it.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="quality-assurance-responsibility-throughout-analysis" class="section level3">
    <h3>Quality assurance responsibility throughout analysis</h3>
    <p>The responsibilities described below are examples of how
    leadership on tasks can be delegated between commissioner, analyst,
    and assurer. No single member of a team should be responsible for an
    entire task without any input or assurance from colleagues [<a href="#References">4</a>]. Though it may be one person’s job to lead
    and shape outputs for a specific aspect of analysis, all team
    members should have a thorough understanding of the principles
    behind the analysis and should be available to help as needed.</p>
    <div id="commissioner-engagement" class="section level4">
    <h4>1. Commissioner engagement</h4>
    <p>This is usually the most preliminary stage of analysis and
    focuses on deciding the guiding question, scope, and context of the
    planned analysis. While there will be few outputs at this step to
    QA, the decisions made will define the level of QA necessary at
    later stages.</p>
    <div id="suggested-qa-documentation" class="section level5">
    <h5>Suggested QA documentation:</h5>
    <ul>
    <li>Specification or scoping document explaining the intended
    outcomes of the analysis, including risks and user needs, which may
    be edited in subsequent stages as details of the requested work
    change [<a href="#References">4</a>]. This can be used at the next
    stage to help create QA plans regarding relevance (ESS Quality
    Dimension 1) and user needs.</li>

    <div id="responsibilities" class="section level5">
    <h5>Responsibilities:</h5>

    that sufficient resources are secured for the analysis, including
    for appropriate quality assurance</li>
    <li>The <strong>Analyst</strong> identifies the levels of quality,
    certainty, and precision that are required for the analysis. They
    should communicate with the commissioner to make sure that they both
    understand what is possible to deliver. This way, the analyst is
    able to complete the appropriate amount of QA that the project
    needs. (the analyst should also ensure they get the right
    information from the commissioner, who may not be familiar with this
    guidance or QA more generally)</li>
    <li>The <strong>Assurer</strong> works with the analyst and
    commissioner to make sure that the proposed levels of quality and
    precision can be achieved. They may need to help the commissioner
    and analyst adjust their plans several times, because they should
    have a high degree of confidence in the project before they sign off
    on the scoping document</li>

    <p>This stage requires a higher degree of technical input as the

    <li>The <strong>Commissioner</strong> passes results on to

    upload to the relevant platform. Where the analysis has been
    commissioned specifically for policymaking, the commissioner should
    ensure that the details of results as well as limitations and
    outstanding risks are clearly communicated so that the analysis can
    be used appropriately</li>
    <li>The <strong>Analyst</strong> ensures that results, risks, and
    limitations are clearly communicated to the commissioner and
    well-recorded in the final publication. They should ensure that any
    published materials have been quality-assured for accessibility and
    transparency. They are responsible for ensuring that the QA log has
    been completed and obtaining a final sign-off from the assurer.
    Looking back at the QA process and outcomes, they should reflect on
    the strong and weak aspects of the process, considering how they
    might apply what they have learned to future analysis</li>
    <li>The <strong>Assurer</strong> checks that suitable QA has been
    completed and is well-documented. If so, the assurer signs off on
    the finished product. Otherwise, they should discuss concerns with
    the analyst and commissioner and ensure these are addressed before
    authorising delivery</li>

    <h3>A note on ensuring data quality</h3>
    <p>Data may come from a large number of sources and may even be
    gathered by the analysts themselves. The complexities involved in
    gathering, storing, managing, and accessing data introduce many
    potential sources of error for a piece of analysis - before analysis
    even commences!</p>
    <p>Ensuring high data quality at the point of collection is an
    extremely involved task that depends on a huge number of situational
    factors and is therefore beyond the scope of this guidance. However,
    the validation of subsequent stages of the “data lifecycle” bears
    discussing here as it is a key aspect of ensuring high quality
    statistical outputs. Under Q3 of the Quality Pillar, the ONS Code of
    Practice explains that “Statistics should be based on the most
    appropriate data to meet intended uses. The impact of any data
    limitations for use should be assessed, minimised and explained.”
    [<a href="#References">1</a>]</p>
    <p>When obtaining data from a database or other storage platform, it
    is best for the analysts to access the data themselves rather than
    request it from a provider. However, this may not be possible in
    some circumstances, and data may have to be requested from a
    provider. In this case, the data providers should keep complete
    records of the queries used to obtain the requested data and share
    those with analysts [<a href="#References">11</a>][<a href="#References">1</a>]. A copy of the original spreadsheets
    provided should also be saved before data cleaning begins, allowing
    for the data cleaning process to be documented from beginning to end
    and for changes to be reversed if needed. Our <a href="...">guidance
    on reproducible analytical pipelines (RAP)</a> notes that software
    such as SQL can be used to query databases using code, which
    provides a record of how data was obtained.</p>
    <p>Some manual checking is usually necessary for analysts to
    identify unreasonable values or distributions [<a href="#References">11</a>], but automated checks can be built into
    the data cleaning pipeline too. Tools such as RMarkdown notebooks
    can be used to create detailed summaries of data and flag any
    potential issues such as outliers or missing values. Any bias,
    uncertainty, or missing values in the data should be documented by
    the analyst. In the final publication, the analyst should explain
    the implications these have on the outputs. [<a href="#References">4</a>]</p>
