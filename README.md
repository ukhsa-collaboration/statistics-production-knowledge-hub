This page has been produced by the statistics production division at UKHSA, to support and promote best practice across our analytical community. While the resources hosted here have been written with UKHSA in mind, all guidance documents are based on Government best practice principles, so the content should have appeal to a wider audience as well. 


From here, you will be able to view our guidance documents:

* Statistical disclosure control for [aggregate data](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/UKHSA-Statistics-Production/knowledge-hub/blob/main/Disclosure%20control/Disclosure-control-for-aggregate-data.html) or [microdata](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/UKHSA-Statistics-Production/knowledge-hub/blob/main/Disclosure%20control/Disclosure-control-for-microdata.html) 

In the [issues tab](https://github.com/UKHSA-Statistics-Production/knowledge-hub/issues) above, you can let us know if you would like us to produce new guidance, make a change to any guidance, or to report a bug with one of our R resources.
